Developing a script to transcribe German words into Japanese sounds using IPA. 
For example the IPA of "Auto" is "aʊ̯to", the first sound "Au" ("aʊ̯") is transcribed as "アオ". My first idea was to break the German words into their syllables and then create a Katakana mapping for all syllables. But since there are [*WAYYYYY*]([https://www.google.com ](https://german.stackexchange.com/questions/70223/how-many-different-syllables-does-the-german-language-have)"How many different syllables does the German language have?") too many German syllables (> 100.000), this approach is not feasible.
